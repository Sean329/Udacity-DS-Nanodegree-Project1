# Udacity-DS-Nanodegree-Project1

The purpose of this project is to build a classification model on top of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, 
trying to predict the Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign); meanwhile comparing different modeling approaches to land on a pontential
most suitable method to deal with this type of data.

The libraries used in this project are as follows:
  Data processing: Numpy, Pandas; 
  Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn; 
  Modeling: Scikit-learn; 

This repo contains 1 file: project1.ipynb, which contains the entire code of modelling.
