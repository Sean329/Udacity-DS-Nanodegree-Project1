# Udacity-DS-Nanodegree-Project1

The purpose of this project is to build a classification model on top of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, 
trying to predict the Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign); meanwhile comparing different modeling approaches to land on a pontential
most suitable method to deal with this type of data.

The libraries used in this project are as follows:

Data processing: Numpy, Pandas; 

Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn; 

Modeling: Scikit-learn; 

This repo contains 2 files: project1.ipynb, which contains the entire code of modelling; and data.csv, which is the dataset.

After the analysis, we are able to land on the modeling approach that best fit this type of task. It turns out to be the Logistic Regression, over the Random Forest and Priciple Component Analysis + Support Vectors Machines.
